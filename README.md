Map of Live Street Webcams of Vancouver

file:///C:/GEOS472/2lab2.html

This map was designed to be an alternative to the traffic feature of Google Maps, as well as a live view of the current weather conditions. The inspiration for this idea is that I am constantly flipping between maps and websites, especially during the winter, to see if it is safe to travel within the city. I check Google Maps to see how congested the roads are, and I look at live webcams to see if there is snow on the roads as well as get an actual understanding of how many cars are on the road.

Since this map is only showing the limited webcam locations - the limited locations that the user can observe live road conditions - I decided to keep the colors of the map very basic and as close to conventional as possible. The only components that I included on the Mapbox style are water, land, roads, and major highways, all of which are symbolized with light blue, sage green, light gray, and yellow/orange, respectively. The colors are all the most basic representations of these components of maps to make the location of the webcams stand out as much as possible. An obvious choice when it comes to labels are major street names; water bodies and parks are not necessary for a map that will mostly be used by locals. 

I had originally planned to add custom markers for the webcams. When I attempted this, the map looked too complicated yet bland as the camera icons that were available for me to use were all black or gray. On top of that, the cluster of webcams in Downtown was very difficult to discern between individual markers; this could have been rectified by having the map zoomed in, but that would defeat the purpose of displaying all the webcams in the city. For this reason, I stuck with red circle markers that contrast with the green fill of the land to symbolize the webcams.

A couple ways I could improve this map is to add a few traffic and safety elements to the map. One idea is to add markers on intersections where there are red light cameras. This would make the map users more conscious of their speed and road safety while driving to their destination because of the possibility of getting a ticket. Another improvement I would make to this map would be to make the website configurable to use on smartphones. Not everyone has the time to open a laptop or desktop computer to check road conditions and would rather use a smartphone for a task like this, therefore this map would probably me most useful if it were compatible with smartphone screens.
